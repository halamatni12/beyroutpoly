# BeirutPoly – A Local Twist on Monopoly

**BeirutPoly** is a creative, localized adaptation of the classic Monopoly board game, reimagined by the Lebanese art collective **Waraq**.

This project debuted in **November 2013** during the **Beirut Street Festival**, not as a traditional board game, but as an **interactive street performance**. It transformed the city into a **life-sized game board**, inviting participants to immerse themselves in Beirut’s unique urban and political landscape.

## Key Features

- 🌆 **Real-life city experience**: Players moved through actual locations in Beirut, facing situations that reflect the city's socio-economic and political complexities.
- 🏙️ **Property acquisition** and community interactions were reimagined to represent **gentrification**, **instability**, and **daily challenges**.
- 🎭 **Satirical and thought-provoking**: The game provided a humorous yet critical take on life in Beirut, encouraging reflection and discussion.

## Purpose

BeirutPoly aims to merge **art and activism** through play, turning the familiar Monopoly mechanics into a **platform for social commentary** and community engagement.
